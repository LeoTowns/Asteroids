1. A docking station that needs to be protected.  The docking station has fuel, missiles.  If you run out of missiles or fuel you die.
2. The docking station has a shield.
3. you have a shield
4. both shields protect you less over time.
5. by shooting asteroids, you protect the docking station.
6. by shooting asteroids, you gain fuel or missiles.
7. over time, more and larger asteroids appear.
8. Over time, you can gain more powerful missiles, more fuel, increased thrust, and a stronger shield
9. a brake option that allows you slow down
10.  Better steering
11. a different ship shape so that you can see which way you're pointing 

1. a docking station object
2. mine asterois for point
3. points are only redeemed at dock
4. aliens try to shoot you, thus taking your loot.

decrement a ctr for a minable asteroid geting shot. mimic code where the asteroid explodes, except maybe the asteroid gives you 
a loot.   

so a photon will need to know that they came from a ship. or a the asteroid must know that it got destroyed by ship.l

if a ship gets hit it loses its loot.

if a ship gets close to a dock, it's position should be set to that of the dock. then you would release it with some key.  So you would need the ship to not dock the ship until its a certain distance away.

For now, do easy stuff:
shield
make ship explode
count lives/get rid of immortality
pause
etc.

Then, add minable asteroid...
Try adding stuff to the ship.
Then add the notion of when you've cleared a screen of minable asteroids.
Add Dock last.

 by next tuesday: get done minable asteroid, pause, shield, die options
