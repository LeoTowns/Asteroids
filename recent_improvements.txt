# this file is a list of improvements we've made to the game
# here, we will enumerate 1.) the changes we've made, 2.) how we made them, and 3.) what points we think they're worth.

improvements:
1. changed ship ship - (the orientation of ship was difficult to determine), this was easy - 0.5pts.
2. I made the ship the self destruct with character 'e', ship blows up.  (Maybe we could have a screen print "GAME OVER")
3. Pause game feature. Use key 'p'. Game pauses and unpauses; this took some edits to game.update().  2pts
4. Ship explodes when it contacts other asteroids.  Ship now has multiple lives.  2pts.
        I did this by having ship inherit from "Shootable" and by changing some conditions in "Photon."
        Ship now has attribute "ship.lives"  the lives of a ship depend on how many deaths it has.
        
            My goal is to implement a world reboot, or a pause in asteroid movement after the ship loses one life.
        During this reboot, the ship will reset its position -> I'd do this because if the ship hits a large asteroid,
        it loses multiple lives, removing the ship from the world ( with ship.leave() ).  This seems unfair.  It would be nice to end the game after a loss of three lives, instead of just removing the ship from the screen.
        A "Game over.  Do you want to play again?  Type y or n." screen would be nice at this point.  'y' would reboot the world and the game. 'n' would quit the game, setting GAME_OVER constant to True.


Goals for game:
1. GUI for Game over and y or n for play again.
2. Game reset of some kind after loss of life
3. create minable asteroids
4. make it so that ships can "land" (method) and "take off" on minable asteroids (and later on the dock).
5. have a point system for 1.) shooting asteroids 2.) mining asteroids
6. have a dock to deposit points and exchange them for upgrades and lives.  Docking secures points? and definitely brings up a menu after ship "lands".
7. upgrades:  1.)increase the speed/range on photon gun. (simply change the speed of the photons)
              2.)buy a temporary shield (with multiple uses, timed)
              3.)mega bomb (clear screen)
              4.)Earn a life
              5.)Earn a ship "stop" method.  Ship stops moving immediately.
