# this file is a list of improvements we've made to the game
# here, we will enumerate 1.) the changes we've made, 2.) how we made them, and 3.) what points we think they're worth.

improvements:
1. changed ship ship - (the orientation of ship was difficult to determine), this was easy - 0.5pts.
2. I made the ship the self destruct with character 'e', ship blows up.  (Maybe we could have a screen print "GAME OVER")
3. Pause game feature. Use key 'p'. Game pauses and unpauses; this took some edits to game.update().  2pts
4. Ship explodes when it contacts other asteroids.  Ship now has multiple lives.  2pts.
        I did this by having ship inherit from "Shootable" and by changing some conditions in "Photon."
        Ship now has attribute "ship.lives"  the lives of a ship depend on how many deaths it has.
        
            My goal is to implement a world reboot, or a pause in asteroid movement after the ship loses one life.
        During this reboot, the ship will reset its position -> I'd do this because if the ship hits a large asteroid,
        it loses multiple lives, removing the ship from the world ( with ship.leave() ).  This seems unfair.  It would be nice to end the game after a loss of three lives, instead of just removing the ship from the screen.
        A "Game over.  Do you want to play again?  Type y or n." screen would be nice at this point.  'y' would reboot the world and the game. 'n' would quit the game, setting GAME_OVER constant to True.



1. an easy improvement would be to lengthen the range of the photon gun! LIFETIME constant in class photon could be extended, so could speed.
2.
