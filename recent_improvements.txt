# this file is a list of improvements we've made to the game
# here, we will enumerate 1.) the changes we've made, 2.) how we made them, and 3.) what points we think they're worth.

improvements:
1. lengthened ship - orientation of ship is difficult to determine, this was easy.
2. I made the ship the self destruct with character 'e', ship blows up.  (Maybe we could have a screen print "GAME OVER")
3. Pause game feature in progress.  Game needs a way to unpause - this means the game should be updating some objects but not others


1. an easy improvement would be to lengthen the range of the photon gun! LIFETIME constant in class photon could be extended, so could speed.
2.
